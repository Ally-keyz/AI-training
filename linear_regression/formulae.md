linear model is calculated as the following

it has a formulae simillar to the slope
where y = mx + b

and we all know that 

y is the predicted output
m is the slope
x is the inputs features
b is the y axis

from the example we had we knew that b or y was the point where the model prediction (y) intercepts with the y axis.

in machine learning the formulae in like

y' = b + w1x1

when relying on multiple features the model formulae gets like this 

y' = b + w1x1 + w2x2 --------
